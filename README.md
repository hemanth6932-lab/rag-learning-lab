# RAG Learning Lab

This repository contains my hands-on implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, built step by step while learning modern LLM application development.

## Current Features
- Data ingestion and parsing
- Preparing documents for vector storage

## Tech Stack
- Python
- LangChain
- FAISS (next step)

## Project Goal
To build production-grade RAG systems including:
- Hybrid search
- Multimodal RAG
- Multi-agent RAG using LangGraph
- Observability using LangSmith
