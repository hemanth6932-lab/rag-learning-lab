Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is an AI architecture that combines information retrieval with text generation.
It retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and uses them to generate accurate responses.

RAG Workflow:
- Load and preprocess documents
- Convert text into embeddings
- Store embeddings in a vector database
- Retrieve relevant chunks at query time
- Generate grounded responses using an LLM

RAG reduces hallucinations and improves factual accuracy in AI systems.
