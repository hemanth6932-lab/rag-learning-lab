Machine Learning Basics

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data
without being explicitly programmed.

Core Concepts:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning
- Model training and evaluation

Machine learning is used in recommendation systems, fraud detection, image recognition,
natural language processing, and predictive analytics.
